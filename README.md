# DCKV

Dicom Contextualized Key Value (DCKV) is a work in progress toward the most optimized representation for DICOM objects.

The  __[wiki](https://github.com/jacquesfauquex/DCKV/wiki)__ part of the repository contains the documentation of this novel  representation.

DCKV is much faster than any other DICOM instance parser.
