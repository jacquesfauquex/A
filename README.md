# DCKV

Dicom Contextualized Key Value (DCKV) is a work in progress toward a new representation for DICOM objects.

The  __[wiki](https://github.com/jacquesfauquex/DCKV/wiki)__ part of the repository contains the definition of the representation.

The code of this repository shows DCKV is much faster than any other DICOM parser. We limit it to instance parsing. Transforming DCKV instances into eDCKV study is not considered here.
